BUGS 03/08/2025

1. The banker in Cell 5 lets you generate cash each time you click accept offer - this button should ot be available if banker has been used already in turn
2. The budget for hiring is a weird / 12 thing - I was trying to sdo something about runway managment / restriction but this is not correct needs to be fixed
